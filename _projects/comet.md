Welcome to the dev blog for Comet!

This is a passion project being brought to life in Unity by a small team of three friends: myself (Sam) and Alex on programming, with Ian bringing our world to life with his art.

We set out to make a game that combines all the genres we love: it's a post-apocalyptic survival and base-building game that is heavily story and character-driven. We're drawing inspiration from our shared interests in survival, prepping, and camping to build a world that feels scary and dangerous, but cozy and safe at your homestead with a community you build.

This page will serve as a dev blog, where I'll post updates, share our progress, and talk about the development process.
