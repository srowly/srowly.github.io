## Hello! I'm Sam.

[cite_start]I'm a **Senior Programmer** with a decade of experience specializing in multi-platform video game development[cite: 15]. [cite_start]My core expertise is in **C# and Unity** [cite: 16][cite_start], but I'm driven by a passion for learning and have a proven ability to quickly master new languages and tools[cite: 16].

This website, which I built myself using Jekyll, is a place for me to showcase my work—both professional and personal.

### Professional Experience

[cite_start]In my 10 years at vTime LTD, I've grown from a Junior Programmer to a Senior Programmer[cite: 29, 30, 31]. [cite_start]I'm a reliable leader [cite: 17] [cite_start]who has experience driving complex features from the initial concept all the way to launch[cite: 17].

* [cite_start]I served as a **lead gameplay developer for *Border Bots VR***, a highly-rated, multi-platform virtual reality game[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]I've directed the full development cycle for cutting-edge VR training applications, collaborating directly with clients like a major Liverpool university[cite: 35].
* [cite_start]I also enjoy mentoring, helping junior engineers grow by leading code reviews and pair programming sessions[cite: 38].

### Personal Projects & Passion

[cite_start]My enthusiasm for programming doesn't end when the workday is over[cite: 57]. I'm constantly working on multiple personal projects to explore new ideas. [cite_start]Currently, I'm deep in development of Comet, a post-apocalyptic homestead survival game using Unity**[cite: 58].

[cite_start]I hold an **MSc in Computer Science (Distinction)** from the University of Liverpool [cite: 44] and love tackling complex programming challenges.

Feel free to look around and check out my projects!
