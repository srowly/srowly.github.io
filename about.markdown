Welcome to my site! I'm Sam Rowlands, a Software Developer in Liverpool. I created this site to document everything I'm up to, completing programming challenges, learning new languages and technologies as well as working on more long term projects.

This site in itself is a project, created using Jekyll, a static site generator written in Ruby and hosted via GitHub pages. It's giving me experience with Ruby and content hosting.

Feel free to browse my projects and past blog posts to get a better idea of the things I'm up to! Cheers
