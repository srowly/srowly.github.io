## Hello! I'm Sam.

I'm a **Senior Programmer** with a decade of experience specializing in multi-platform video game development. My core expertise is in **C# and Unity**, but I'm driven by a passion for learning and have a proven ability to quickly master new languages and tools.

This website, which I built myself using Jekyll, is a place for me to showcase my work—both professional and personal.

### Professional Experience

In my 10 years at vTime LTD, I've grown from a Junior Programmer to a Senior Programmer. I'm a reliable leader who has experience driving complex features from the initial concept all the way to launch.

* I served as a **lead gameplay developer for *Border Bots VR***, a highly-rated, multi-platform virtual reality game.
* I directed the full development cycle for a cutting-edge VR training application, collaborating directly with a major Liverpool university.
* I also enjoy mentoring, helping junior engineers grow by leading code reviews and pair programming sessions.

### Personal Projects & Passion

My enthusiasm for programming doesn't end when the workday is over. I'm constantly working on multiple personal projects to explore new ideas. Currently, I'm deep in development of Comet, a post-apocalyptic homestead survival game using Unity.

I hold an **MSc in Computer Science (Distinction)** from the University of Liverpool and love tackling complex programming challenges.

Feel free to look around and check out my projects!
